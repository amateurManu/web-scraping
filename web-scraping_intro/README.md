# Web Scraping - Intro

In this introduction to web scraping using the BeautifulSoup library, I worked with a simple HTML file to test out some basic features of the library.

Much of the credit should be accorded to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0) for the content in this directory and some of the content in the following directories.


Check out the BeautifulSoup documentation to get familiar with how to use the library. Some methods I have gone through in this code include:
- `find()` - which looks for the specified HTML elements, but stops after finding the first element.
- `find_all()` - looks for all the HTML elements specified.
- `prettify()` - serves the content in a more readable way
